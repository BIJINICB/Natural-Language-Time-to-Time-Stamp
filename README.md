# Natural-Language-Time_to_Time-Stamp
Converting the date N days ago in Python to Time-stamp
if we have strings that show a date in the following format like:

x minutes/hours/days/months/years ago
 
to parse that to a datetime using python, i just find a way to convert in the form of DD-MM-YY-HH-MM-SS

By using this code we can convert a list of 'x time ago' to date-time
